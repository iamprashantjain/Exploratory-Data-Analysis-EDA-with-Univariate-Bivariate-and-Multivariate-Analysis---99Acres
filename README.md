I analyzed a dataset to understand its patterns and relationships. The study had three parts:

Univariate Analysis:
First, I looked at individual variables, checking how they're spread out. I used visuals like histograms and box plots to understand basic characteristics.

Bivariate Analysis:
Next, I studied connections between pairs of variables. Scatter plots and correlation matrices helped find relationships and patterns in the data.

Multivariate Analysis:
Lastly, I explored interactions between three or more variables. Techniques like heatmaps and 3D scatter plots revealed complex relationships.

I commented throughout the code, explaining my findings and insights. This makes it easy for anyone to understand the dataset and its patterns. The detailed comments ensure stakeholders can use the insights effectively.
